      <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer1')">What are the admission requirements?</div>
      <div class="answer" id="answer1">
        <p>The academic entry requirement is high school diploma or equivalent and IELTS 5 or equivalent.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer2')">What if don’t have any recent IELTS scores?</div>
      <div class="answer" id="answer2">
        <p>Students can take an English Placement Test (free-of-charge) once they arrive at the university. If a student’s English level is below the minimum requirement of IELTS 5, the student would need to take some English subjects before starting the program.
            Please see the section English Placement Test for more details.</p>

      <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer3')">How long does the admissions process take?</div>
      <div class="answer" id="answer3">
        <p>Once we have the completed application file, including all required materials, it usually takes a few days to a week for application processing, review, and for your Letter of Acceptance to be sent by email. You will then be required to pay a non-refundable partial payment 30% of tuition fees of the semester before your visa supporting document is granted. The remaining 70% of the fees are paid once you arrived at the university. Please note, the partial payment may be changed based on your country of origin.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer4')">Where do I get my visa and how long does it take to have it?</div>
      <div class="answer" id="answer4">
        <p>Once we received the non-refundable partial payment 30% of tuition fees, we will process your visa supporting document and send to you via email or postal. Then you can lodge your visa application at nearest Thai Embassy or consulate in your country, which could take at least 1 week to 1 month, depending on the visa processing requirement of the Thai embassy or consulate in your country, which you have provided to us during your online application.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer5')">What documents must I present to get my visa?</div>
      <div class="answer" id="answer5">
        <p>We will provide you a scan copy of the visa issuance letter sent to your email and these documents are also sent by EMS to the postal address you specified on the online application form. Once you received the original visa issuance letter, all these documents must be submitted to the Thai embassy or consulate for you to be granted the visa.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer6')">What if I studied before from another college or university?</div>
      <div class="answer" id="answer6">
        <p>If you have successfully completed units or subjects from another institution, either in Thailand or overseas or from a different degree at Rangsit University, you may apply for credit transfer that may reduce the time you take to complete your current degree.
            The student is allowed to transfer a maximum of 75% of the total credits for the current program he is studying. The subjects eligible for credit transfer must have an exact equivalent credit value or higher, and a completed grade of C or above.
            Please see the section Credit Transfer for more details.</p>
